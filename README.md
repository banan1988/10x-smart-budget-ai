## AI Ready

This project is designed to be **AI Ready**, with a clear separation of concerns that allows for easy integration of artificial intelligence features. The backend is prepared to handle AI-powered logic, such as providing smart budget recommendations and financial insights, while the frontend is set up to consume and display this data effectively.

The use of Supabase for the backend and a well-defined API structure in Astro allows for seamless communication between the client and any AI services.

## Project Scope

Based on the Project Requirements Document (PRD), the scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of SmartBudgetAI includes the following key features:

### 1. User Account Management
- **Registration:** Users can sign up with an email and password.
- **Login:** Registered users can log in to access their account.
- **Account Deletion:** Users can permanently delete their account and all associated data.

### 2. Transaction Management (CRUD)
- **Add Transaction:** A modal window allows users to add new transactions with fields for amount (in PLN), description, and date.
- **View Transactions:** A list of transactions for the current month is displayed on the main screen, with navigation to previous and next months.
- **Edit Transaction:** Users can modify the amount, description, and date of existing transactions.
- **Delete Transaction:** Users can remove individual transactions.

### 3. AI-Powered Categorization
- **Automatic Categorization:** When a transaction is added, its description is sent to an AI model to be automatically assigned a category from a predefined list.
- **Error Handling:** Ifd the AI fails to assign a category, the transaction is automatically labeled as "Other."

### 4. Main Dashboard
- **Default View:** The main screen after login, showing data for the current month.
- **Expense Chart:** A bar chart displaying the top 5 spending categories and an "Other" category for the rest.
- **AI Summary:** A brief, 2-3 sentence natural language summary of the last month's spending, generated by AI.
- **Empty State:** A message encouraging users to add their first transaction if there are none for the current month.

### 5. Feedback Collection
- A simple pop-up to collect user feedback on the application's usefulness on a scale of 1 to 5, with an optional comment field.
